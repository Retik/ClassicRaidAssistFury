# Classic Raid Assist Fury

Classic Raid Assist Fury is an addon intended to bring more functionality to raid leaders and raid groups. It is meant to help manage the raids and reduce the amount of headaches that come with raiding in Classic WoW.

## Classic Raid Assist Fury brings these functionalities to your raid:
- Scans your raid for Buffs and Consumables on Ready Check so you can always know that your raid is fully prepared.
- Checks every member of your raid/group for their Raid Buffs and makes it convenient to output to chat to show who is missing the buffs.
- Checks every member of your raid for World Buffs and makes it convenient to output to chat to show who is has the buffs.
- Checks members of the raid for items in their inventory that are useful to the raid (Aqual/Eternal Quintessence, Onxyia Scale Cloak, Drakefire Amulet, Seal of Ascension). You can only be checked for the items in the dropdown and you can turn this option off in the setting section. NOTE: This requires everyone in the raid to have this addon to work properly.
- Displays who's loot it is on each mob's tooltip. This is useful for you skinning Corehounds in MC. NOTE: This requires everyone in the raid to have this addon to work properly.

Loot:
To see who's loot it is in raids make sure to have every raid member download this addon. Once you have that the addon will add a Looter: {raid_member} to the tooltip icon, as shown in the images.

## Consumables Tab
If you open up the Consumables tab you will see a few drop downs. The first being Buff or Item. This drop down is meant to show you for the spec you choose if they have the buff applied, or if they have the item for the buff. The items list is often longer due to some items not giving buffs (such as arrows for hunters). You can then choose a spec to scan off of. Once you've choosen both you can select which buffs you want to scan for then scan away and be shown who does/doesn't have those buffs and items. NOTE Everyone in the raid must be using this addon for this to work. If they don't have the addon then it will not work. As you use this please note if anything doesnt seem right, the links I got the lists from and the spell id's dont always seem to be 100% correct and its very possible that it may be entered wrong. If you encounter this please make a comment below about it!!

## All Classes Consumables:
There is a dropdown that will show all the classes consumables for your raid when you hit scan, it will be based off the other spec's dropdowns that were previously selected. This is the same information that will be output on ready check.

## Raid Buffs
If you open up the GUI with the minimap icon there is a Raid Buffs tab. On this tab you can select which buffs to check for. Once selected you can click the Scan for Raid Buffs button to scan everyone in your raid/group if they have those buffs. This checks to see if they have the group buff or the single target buff. You can click the Report button with a channel to output who is missing specific buffs.

## WorldBuffs
If you open up the GUI with the minimap icon there is a World Buffs tab. On this tab you can select which buffs to check for. Once selected you can click the Scan for World Buffs button to scan everyone in your raid/group if they have those buffs. This will show if they have that raid buff. You can then report it to a channel and it will output who does have buffs.

## PaladinBuffs
If you open up the GUI with the minimap icon there is a Paladin Buffs tab. On this tab you can select which buffs to check for. Once selected you can click the Scan for Paladin Buffs button to scan everyone in your raid/group if they have those buffs. This will show if they have that raid buff. You can then report it to a channel and it will output who does have buffs.

## Raid Items
If you open up the Raid Items tab you can select from a drop down which items to look for. Only these items are possible to be scanned for so you dont have to worry about someone going through your bags and looking at your items. You can also report these items out to the raid, showing who does and doesnt have them.

## Settings
The Settings tab allows you to control settings, such as not allowing item scanning, and to scan your raid to see what versions of the addon they have, if at all. Its important to make sure people have the addon for the Raid Items and Looting portions of the addon to work properly.

## Smart Buff Filtering:
Smart buff filtering allows you to not show classes that dont need certain buffs, for instance a Warrior doesnt need Arcane Intellect and a Warlock doesnt need Blessing of Might. If you notice that there are other combos that dont need certain buffs please feel free to leave a comment below so I can add it in!
